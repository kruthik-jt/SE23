|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|Contributors Page: The productivity is evenly distributed amongst team members. Judging based on the number of commits, and not the quality, the distribution is pretty good.|The productivity is evenly distributed amongst team members. Judging based on the number of commits, and not the quality, the distribution is pretty good.|||||||||
|Number of commits|3|184 commits made over 3 months of time which indicates good distribution of work.||||||||||
|Number of commits: by different people|3|478 Commits. A decent amount of incremental work||||||||||
|Issues reports: there are many|2|15 issues in totality||||||||||
